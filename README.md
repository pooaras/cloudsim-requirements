To launch a virtual machine in OpenStack using DevStack, you'll first need to have DevStack installed and configured on your system. DevStack is a set of scripts that help you set up an OpenStack development environment for testing and development purposes. Here's a step-by-step procedure to create and launch a virtual machine (VM) in OpenStack using DevStack:


Prepare Your System:

Make sure you have a clean Ubuntu-based system. DevStack is typically used on Ubuntu.
Ensure your system meets the minimum hardware requirements, including sufficient RAM and CPU.



Install DevStack:


Clone the DevStack repository from GitHub:
git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack
cd devstack



Create a local.conf file in the devstack directory. This file will be used for configuring DevStack. You can use a sample local.conf as a starting point, and customize it according to your needs.


Run the DevStack installation script:
./stack.sh



This will take some time, as it downloads and installs the required components for OpenStack.


Access OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon):

Once DevStack is successfully installed, you can access the OpenStack Horizon dashboard by opening a web browser and visiting http://<your-server-ip>/horizon. Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin) or the credentials you set in your local.conf file.



Create a Project (Tenant):

In the Horizon dashboard, go to "Identity" and create a new project (also known as a tenant). This is where you will launch your virtual machine.



Create a Network:

Under the "Network" section in Horizon, create a network. This network will be used to connect your VM to the outside world.



Launch an Instance (VM):

In the Horizon dashboard, go to "Compute" and select "Instances."
Click the "Launch Instance" button.
Fill out the necessary details, including the image, flavor, key pair, and network. You can use an image like CirrOS for testing purposes.
Launch the instance.



Access the VM:

Once the VM is launched, you can access it through SSH (if you provided a key pair during instance creation) or using VNC if you configured it to use a console.



This is a basic procedure for launching a VM in OpenStack using DevStack. Remember to customize the local.conf file and OpenStack configurations to match your specific requirements. It's important to familiarize yourself with the OpenStack documentation for more advanced configurations and features.
